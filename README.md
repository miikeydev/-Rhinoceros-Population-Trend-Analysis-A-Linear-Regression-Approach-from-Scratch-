# -Rhinoceros-Population-Trend-Analysis-A-Linear-Regression-Approach-from-Scratch-


As a machine learning enthusiast, I embarked on a journey to delve into the mathematical foundation of linear regression. I set myself a challenge to not only collect my own dataset but also to code the linear regression from scratch, relying solely on tools like NumPy, Matplotlib, and pandas. The aim was to grasp the mathematical concepts thoroughly before implementing them. My approach involved a theoretical phase to understand the key principles, followed by a matrix-based phase. It's essential to remember that four components are crucial: a dataset, a model, a cost function, and an optimizer. In my case, I curated the dataset by gathering internet data on rhinoceros population trends since 1992. This mini-database exhibited a linear pattern, making it suitable for linear regression. After compiling the data into an Excel file, I utilized pandas to import it into a NumPy array for manipulation. The model was straightforward, essentially a linear equation of the form y = ax + b, with a and b as the parameters to estimate. For the cost function, I opted for the mean squared error, although absolute error was also a consideration. However, for simplicity in calculation, I preferred the former. The gradient descent method was chosen as the optimizer due to its simplicity and effectiveness across various domains, including neural networks. Here, I've attached the code and dataset for review
